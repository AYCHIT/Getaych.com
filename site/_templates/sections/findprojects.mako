<p>If you are looking to help &mdash; but are not the maintainer of a module, library,
etc. &mdash; there are various ways you can help. For example, see Brett Cannon's
"<a href="http://py3ksupport.appspot.com/">Python 3 Support on PyPI</a>" site,
that lists various projects that support, or do not support Python 3. You
can always find a project there that can use assistance in
porting.</p>
